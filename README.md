# Rule Extraction Using Genetic Algorithm

In this project, genetic algorithm was employed to extract rules from the [provided dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/411/extention+of+z+alizadeh+sani+dataset).

First, it is required to run the `dataset.ipynb` to create the `binarized.csv` file, which devides each feature's value range into 3 groups represented by a binary code.

Then, rule `extraction.ipynb` file extracts rules from the new dataset, using genetic algorithm.
